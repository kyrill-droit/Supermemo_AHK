# Supermemo_AHK
Hello Supermemo adepts,

I wanted to simulate in Supermemo (SM) new cards per day similar to Anki or other SRS. It requires some manipulations in the SM, which in everyday use become a chore. This Autohotkey script requires just pressing two keys: RightAlt  (AltGr) and End, on freshly started SM. Hope it serves you well.
