# Supermemo_AHK
Hello Supermemo adepts,

I wanted to simulate in the Supermemo (SM) new cards per day similar to Anki or other SRS. It requires some manipulations in the SM, which in everyday use become a chore. This Autohotkey script requires just pressing two keys: _RightAlt (AltGr)_ and _End_, on freshly started SM.

After installing Autohotkey you may Compile Script of the .ahk file and put it into your Startup folder. This folder is accessible by finding _Run_, then typing _shell:startup_.

Hope it serves you well.

Autohotkey may be downloaded here: https://www.autohotkey.com/
